Chapter 1 <span>The Last Class</span>
</div>

<p>
No one ever imagines the end of the world smells like <strong>floor polish</strong> and <strong>chalk dust</strong>.<br><br>
That morning, the classroom hummed with its usual inertia: the low scrape of chairs, the
scratch of pens on notebooks, the half-hearted sighs of students who had already been
awake too long. The sun slanted lazily across the city, brushing over concrete and glass
with a golden hue that seemed reluctant to illuminate a world already tired. The sky looked
tired, almost reluctant to be blue—the kind of day that warned you without words, if you
were paying attention. <br><br>
It was the second period. Computer Science. Mr. Dev’s class—the man who made syntax
sound like philosophy and sarcasm sound like oxygen.
He stood at the front, sleeves rolled up, holding a whiteboard marker like a weapon.
“Today,” he said, “we will learn recursion. The art of making the same mistake again and
again, until your program—<em>or your life</em>—crashes.”<br><br>
Half the class groaned. I smiled. He wasn’t wrong.<br><br>
Outside, the sky began to hum—that low, static vibration that had become part of city life
ever since the airborne alerts started flashing on the news. We all knew something was
spreading, something invisible. But the government said it was “contained.” They always
say that before they disappear from the broadcast.<br><br>
In the classroom next to ours, someone coughed.<br><br>
It sounded <strong>wet</strong>.<br><br>
Then came another.<br><br>
Then several, in a rhythm that no longer felt human.<br><br>
Siddharth turned his head, frowning. “They’re still doing PE, right?”<br><br>
Mr. Dev opened his mouth to answer, but the coughing turned into retching. A chair
scraped violently against the floor. Something fell. Something heavy. And then silence. The
kind that doesn’t fade.<br><br>
Mr. Dev lowered his marker. The sound of its cap clicking back on was the loudest thing in
the room.<br><br>
I don’t know what moved me. Instinct, maybe. I crossed the room and slammed our
windows shut. The metal frames groaned like they didn’t want to obey. Then I locked them.<br><br>
All of them. I drew the curtains tight.<br><br>
Everyone stared at me like I’d lost it.<br><br>
Mr. Dev raised an eyebrow. “Planning a surprise party?”<br><br>
I almost laughed. “Just… something felt wrong.”<br><br>
It did. The air outside wasn’t moving right. The trees in the courtyard weren’t
swaying—they were holding still, like they were listening too.<br><br>
Minutes dragged. We waited for someone to check in from the next class. No one did.<br><br>
When Tanya—the class bully—got up to peek through the curtain, I stopped her. “Don’t.”<br><br>
She rolled her eyes. “You think air’s going to bite me?”<br><br>
She didn’t open it. Not then.<br><br>
Mr. Dev, with that eerie calm of his, walked to his desk, sat down, and sighed. “Well,” he
said, “attendance is finally improving.”<br><br>
We laughed. Not because it was funny, but because laughter felt like proof we were still
alive.<br><br>
By noon, the laughter died. The corridor smelled faintly like copper and rot. Something was
leaking—not from the ceiling, but the air vents.<br><br>
Aarav said his head hurt. Ishani went quiet. Arjun adjusted his glasses every five seconds,
like he was trying to focus on something that wasn’t real.<br><br>
That’s when the alarms started. Not the fire kind. The evacuation ones.<br><br>
The school’s loudspeakers crackled, stuttered, then said just one word before dying again:
<strong>“CONTAINMENT.”</strong><br><br>
Then nothing. No teachers. No footsteps. No screams. Just the soft hiss of dying electricity.<br><br>
We waited. We hoped someone would come.<br><br>
They didn’t.<br><br>
By evening, the light through the curtains turned gold, then gray, then the color of paper
ash.<br><br>
I don’t know who said it first, but someone whispered, “We’re running out of air.”<br><br>
We had closed everything. Sealed ourselves perfectly.<br><br>
We had saved our lives… and trapped them too. The paradox hung in the room, taut and
suffocating.<br><br>
Mr. Dev looked at us one by one—seven students, one teacher, eight souls suspended
between panic and denial. He spoke softly, like someone giving a bedtime story to fear
itself.<br><br>
“Alright, troops. We’ll need supplies. Food, water, air. Any volunteers?”<br><br>
Siddharth raised his hand before I could stop him. “I’ll go.”<br><br>
I did too. “You’ll need someone to carry the stuff.”<br><br>
Arjun hesitated—the smallest, youngest of us—but then stood up. “I’ll come. For oxygen.”<br><br>
Mr. Dev nodded slowly. “Smart. Team three. Bring me back something worth breathing
for.”<br><br>
We tore strips of fabric for makeshift masks, soaked them in bleach from the lab. The
hallways felt endless now, the kind of silence that vibrates through bone.<br><br>
We split near the main stairs.<br><br>
I went to the staff room. Everything smelled stale—milk turned sour, coffee abandoned
mid-sip. I found a half-box of chips, some fruit, and what looked like salvation in a steel
tiffin.<br><br>
Sid raided the vending machines for water. He came back, panting, shirt wrapped around
his face like armor. “Got enough,” he gasped. “Barely made it past the library, the doors
there are stuck.”<br><br>
I smiled under my mask. “You <em>always</em> make it.”<br><br>
We waited for Arjun.<br>
Ten minutes.<br>
Twenty.<br>
An hour.<br><br>
When he stumbled back, the light in his eyes was gone. “Guys, I- I think I touched
something… something bad”. He was drenched in sweat, shaking, muttering half-words.
Then came the vomiting—loud, violent, relentless.<br><br>
Everyone froze. Tanya backed into the corner, hand over her mouth. “He’s infected.”<br><br>
Mr. Dev said nothing. His jaw tightened. His hand twitched toward him—then stopped.<br><br>
Arjun’s breathing slowed. He looked at me—just for a second—terrified. Then he tried to
say something. His mouth opened. Nothing came out but blood.<br><br>
And before any of us could move, Tanya acted. She didn't shove him toward the sealed
window, but she cornered him, toward the reinforced steel door to the hallway. The
moment he stumbled across the threshold, she slammed the door shut. The deadbolt
mechanism engaged with a final, chilling <em>thunk</em>.<br><br>
Tanya leaned against the door, panting, her eyes wide with a manic purpose. "He's
infected," she hissed. "We don't share air with the dead."<br><br>
Silence. The faint, horrifying sound of Arjun retching and desperately beating against the
metal faded until all we heard was his final, strangled gasping, sealed out in the toxic air.<br><br>
</p>

<div class="dot-break">• • • • • • •</div>
<h3 class="chapter-sub">The Aftermath</h3>

<p>
We all stared at the door, the finality of the lock painting our faces in orange grief.<br>
Aarav whimpered. Ishani turned away.<br>
Mr. Dev closed his eyes and whispered, “Well… that escalated quickly.”<br>
The words hung like smoke. No one laughed this time.<br>
The air inside felt heavy. The air outside felt deadlier. I couldn’t tell which prison was
worse.<br><br>
We barricaded the door with chairs and desks. Every breath felt measured. Every
movement sounded like it would summon catastrophe.<br><br>
Hours passed. Shadows stretched across the ceiling, painted in the dim orange glow of the
sunset. Tanya muttered curses under her breath. Sid hummed nervously, an attempt at
calm, while Aarav huddled silently, tears streaming down his face.<br><br>
I checked the makeshift masks again. The bleach had dried, leaving a thin, bitter film across
our faces. It reminded me that survival had a taste—one that lingered unpleasantly on the
tongue.<br><br>
Mr. Dev moved among us slowly, inspecting our barricades, our masks, our bodies. He
paused beside me, eyes scanning the room. “Discipline,” he said quietly, “is breathing in
rhythm with fear. Control the small things and the large ones might ignore you.”<br><br>
I nodded. He turned away, adjusting a chair against the door. Even his calm was
unsettling—the kind that tells you the world is worse than you imagine.<br><br>
Night deepened. The hum outside became sharper, pressing against the walls like the city
itself was holding its breath. We whispered plans: rotating shifts, rationing, assigning
lookout points. Every suggestion carried the weight of death.<br><br>
By midnight, hunger was a faint shadow behind panic. By one a.m., the fear of suffocating
pressed on our chests as heavily as the fear of infection. Every cough, every drip of liquid
somewhere in the building, made us flinch. Somewhere far away, a bell rang. Just once.<br><br>
Hollow. Faint. An echo of normalcy that was no longer real.<br>
No one moved. We didn’t breathe too loudly. The air itself seemed hostile.<br><br>
I caught Sid’s eye. He gave a small, trembling nod. It was agreement—not hope, but
acknowledgment that we were still alive. That in itself was enough. I huddled with the
others, trying to remember what normal felt like. The smell of chalk dust. Floor polish. The
static hum. The laughter. The sunlight. All of it was still there, trapped beneath a thin, cruel
layer of apocalypse.<br><br>
And I realized—this was only the beginning. The school building became our cage, our
sanctuary, our tomb.<br>
We were six students and one teacher. Alive, yes. But how long before the air itself
betrayed us?<br>
We waited.<br>
And we breathed. <em>Carefully.</em>
</p>

<div class="chapter-title">
Chapter 2
<span>The Silence After Bell</span>
</div>
<p>
The moment the final thunk of the deadbolt echoed through the thick steel door, the world
inverted. We were no longer simply trapped; we were sealed. We were six breaths left in a
room designed for seventy, and one of those six was a murderer.
I didn't move. Moving costs oxygen, and right now, oxygen was the currency of survival. I
held my breath, calibrating the panic flooding my system, reducing it to cold, usable data.
My mind ran a frantic loop:
Input: Arjun is gone.
Input: Tanya is a direct threat.
Input: The room is contaminated.
Action: Quantify and Control.
Every nerve ending screamed, but my frontal lobe imposed a firewall, filtering the terror
into a solvable equation.
The air itself felt like wet cement against my lungs. It was thick with the immediate
trauma—the sharp, metallic scent of blood, the sour, bile-ridden odor of what Tanya
claimed was infection, and a faint, acrid chemical tang from the bleach we'd used on our
makeshift masks. Every inhale was a transaction: a tiny intake of diminishing life for a great
release of measured dread. The ambient temperature, always slightly too warm in this
poorly vented classroom, was now rising, coating everything in a clammy film that
amplified the claustrophobia.
Tanya was the first to reclaim space. She peeled her body off the reinforced steel door,
breathing hard, but not with fear. Her chest rose and fell with a disturbing sense of
triumph. She didn’t look guilty; she looked justified, an extremist vindicated by the
perceived purity of her action.
“He was infected,” she gasped, wiping sweat from her brow, not a drop of genuine sorrow
in her eyes. “You all saw it. He was vomiting blood. We can’t share air with the dead.
Survival doesn’t need kindness. It needs control. It needs action.”
Her words were meant for us, a proclamation of her new, ruthless authority. The glance she
cast toward Sid, however, was a deliberate, pointed challenge. Siddharth, the protector, the
embodiment of courage, failed to rise. He was crouched against the back wall, his massive
frame shaking in silent, agonizing shock. Arjun had been his closest friend, and Sid’s
self-sacrificial nature had utterly broken beneath the weight of inaction. He had watched
and done nothing. His courage had choked on the fear of contamination, the fear that
Tanya had weaponized. He was useless—a powerful asset reduced to a panicked liability,
consuming valuable oxygen in his terror.
Mr. Dev, usually a steady current of dry wit, was pale, his hands clasped so tightly they were
white at the knuckles. “We need to clean this,” he stated, his voice flat, stripped of all
sarcasm. “That… that mess is a hazard. We can’t leave it.” He reached for a discarded hand
towel, but his hand froze halfway, unable to touch the physical proof of our moral
compromise. It was a detail I logged: the intellectual pillar of the group was paralyzed by
the psychological fallout.
Ishani, our quiet core of empathy, moved before anyone else could seize the moment. She
didn't look at Tanya or Sid, but only at the spreading stain on the floor. Her empathy, which
I always thought was her weakness, became an instant purpose. Her movements were slow,
almost meditative. She took the towel from Mr. Dev’s hand, walked to the meager water
supply, the bottles Sid had wrestled from the vending machine, and wet the fabric.
It was a ritual of denial. She scrubbed the area where Arjun had stumbled back into the
room, methodically sanitizing the floor with slow, quiet strokes. She wasn't just cleaning a
biological mess; she was cleaning the conscience of the group, desperately trying to prove
that kindness could still exist here. She worked until the towel was soaked crimson and the
floor was merely damp and smelling faintly of disinfectant. Ishani had finally finished
wringing the stained towel into a bucket, the last remnant of the tragedy visually removed.
Aarav, the crybaby but a genius, watched Ishani working. He wasn't crying, yet. He was
vibrating, his energy trapped between terror and observation. He let out a low, pathetic
whimper that was closer to a mechanical noise than human grief. He was absorbing the
terror of the room, preparing to channel it into something else.
While Ishani worked, I ran my priority loop: Resource Management. My gaze fixed solely on
Tanya. If I let her control the supplies, she would use them not for survival, but for absolute
domination.
“We need to ration the supplies immediately,” I stated, cutting through the heavy
atmosphere. My voice was level, focused entirely on quantifiable data. “Sid, you need the
most air. Your size requires a larger metabolic exchange, which means you are our most
vulnerable asset and cannot be our runner right now.”
Sid didn't even look up to hear the assessment of his own body as a liability.
“Tanya, you’re our physically weakest asset. Your reckless reactions will burn through
oxygen we can’t afford to waste. Control has to come from calculation, not impulse.” As I
stressed the last word, I was already mapping her weaknesses onto our immediate needs.
Tanya immediately bristled, her eyes narrowing in challenge. "I'll take charge of the water
and food. I know how to make supplies last under pressure. It's too important to leave to
theory."
“No,” I countered, my tone entirely clinical. “We established rules of breathing before, when
I secured the room. The person who created the initial containment system manages the
logistics of its failure. I’ll manage the rations and the air quality calculations.” I didn't wait
for her agreement. I took the small bag of fruit and chips from the staff room, and the
remaining water bottles. I secured it all beneath my desk, out of Tanya’s reach, adding the
small, reassuring clatter of metal against wood to the silent room.
I watched the muscle tick in Tanya’s jaw. Her fear manifests as control. My control must
neutralize her fear. I understood then that my greatest advantage was my capacity to
divorce emotion from necessity; Tanya's was her willingness to sacrifice everything else. I
had won the first tactical battle for the supplies, but the war for authority was far from
over.
Tanya scoffed, her lip curling in cold frustration, but she didn't challenge the physical act
directly. Instead, she chose a corner of the room, pulled a chair, and sat facing us, a silent,
watchful judge.
Meanwhile, the room was degrading. The increasing carbon dioxide level was no longer
theoretical; it was physical. A thin sheen of sweat covered Mr. Dev's forehead. Ishani had
finished cleaning, but her hands were shaking, and her breathing was shallow. My own
focus began to drift, colors looking slightly muted, the edges of panic fuzzing the sharp
corners of my analysis. The constant, dull ache behind my eyes was the cost of every breath
we’d taken, the chemical consequence of our fear. I pressed my fingers against my temples,
trying to force the blood to carry more oxygen.
It was Aarav who finally broke the tension, not with a scream, but a rambling, panicked
complaint.
“My head… my head still hurts,” he stammered, pulling at his hair. “The air is too heavy. It’s
too slow, too thick. We used too many breaths arguing. We wasted too many breaths on
arguing… about him.” He gestured vaguely toward the door, then shrank back, instantly
terrified of what he had implied.
He was undeniably right. The air was a finite resource, and every word was a measurable
waste. Our initial supply run had bought us time, but Arjun’s contamination and the
subsequent conflict had consumed precious seconds.
“Aarav,” Mr. Dev began, his voice strained, “deep breaths. Control.”
But Mr. Dev was also faltering. His eyes landed on the spot where Arjun always sat—the
small, youngest member of the group, now vanished. Arjun’s school bag was gone, taken
when he returned from the run, but his small, wire-rimmed glasses lay forgotten on the
floor beside his overturned chair.
It was an unbearable detail. Mr. Dev walked over and picked them up, his hands shaking
slightly, and placed them gently on the desk, lining them up with the desk's edge. It was the
only funeral we would have.
The silence returned, but this time, it felt heavier, colder, defined by the empty chair and
the discarded glasses. We were seven at the start. Now we were six. And one of those six
was a predator.
Something in me switched. Fear became math. Survival became numbers. I pulled out my
phone, the battery nearly dead, and accessed the school's old, unsecured server I'd hacked
into weeks ago for a project. I needed data. What was the internal cubic meter volume of
the room? What was the natural leak rate of the sealed windows? Could I calculate our
Time-To-Suffocation (Ts
) based on average human oxygen consumption (VO2
)?
I keyed in the data: VO2 for six people (adjusting Siddharth's rate upwards). I calculated the
internal volume V: approximately 500m3
. I needed a variable for the contamination rate. I
didn't have one. The result was useless, a logic loop that only ended in failure. I needed a
new variable, a new input, or the result would always be zero.
Just as the quiet desperation reached its peak, the low static hum I had noticed before
returned. It wasn't just the failing electricity; it was deeper, resonating through the
concrete floor and up the walls. It was rhythmic, like a mechanical intake, then a slow,
ragged exhale.
thrum... hiss... thrum... hiss...
The building itself was breathing, and it was getting closer. It was too regular to be settling
and too loud to be distant. It was coming from the floor, and I realized with a fresh surge of
dread: if that rhythm continued, it would consume all the remaining air in this room. The
sealed sanctuary was about to become a vacuum.
I looked from the empty chair, to the determined malice in Tanya’s eyes, to the quiet,
rhythmic threat of the floor. The problem wasn't what was outside. It was what was sealed
in here with us—Tanya, the fear, and the rapidly shrinking air. I had to find a way to stop
the rhythm, or we wouldn't last the night.
Chapter 3:
The Air Turns Heavy
The air did not just turn heavy; it turned hostile. It was no longer a silent thief; it was
physical weight, pressing against my temples, slowing my thoughts into sluggish, muddy
movements. The dawn that crept through the curtains was a pale, sickening orange, and it
illuminated a group that was visibly suffering. We had survived the first night, but survival
felt like an insult.
Every single person in the room—myself included—was a liability now. My brain, deprived of
its essential fuel, was betraying me. The atmosphere was thick with the immediate trauma
of Arjun’s expulsion, the lingering stench of fear, and the rapidly increasing concentration
of carbon dioxide. The chemical byproducts of our own survival were turning our sanctuary
into a slow-acting gas chamber.
The first physical symptom I logged was the headache. It started behind the eyes, a dull,
insistent throb that made focusing on the complex equations of air consumption
impossible. Then came the nausea, a constant, rolling sensation that made the stale smell of
the room unbearable. The lack of clean oxygen was like a corrosive acid, eating away at the
edges of reality. Colors seemed slightly muted, and the edges of objects shimmered with a
feverish heat.
Sid, still crumpled against the wall, was the worst casualty of our dwindling air supply. His
large muscles, which demanded a disproportionate amount of oxygen even at rest, were
twitching uncontrollably. His face was flushed with the effort of breathing, and his breaths
were shallow and fast—a desperate, biological attempt to compensate that only exacerbated
the situation by cycling more CO2 through his system. He looked less like a protective
presence and more like a massive, oxygen-starved engine running on fumes. The shame of
his inaction regarding Arjun was a psychological weight that compounded his physical
distress, reducing the group’s strongest asset into its biggest metabolic drain.
Tanya, despite her claimed physical weakness, seemed unnaturally steady, which only
amplified my distrust. She sat in her corner, rigid, eyes flicking between me (the resource
manager) and Siddharth (the visible threat to those resources). She was rationing her fear
and her energy, using silence as a weapon and observation as my primary defense. She
looked like a taut bowstring, waiting for the perfect moment to release.
Mr. Dev tried to break the psychological silence with logic, his voice thick and slow, the
words having to fight their way through the haze in his mind. “We should designate a
breathing rhythm. Inhale deeply... exhale slowly. Control the rate of combustion. Discipline
is breathing in rhythm with fear.”
We attempted it. Six people trying to breathe in sync was a terrifying ballet of desperation,
each participant acutely aware that their neighbors’ failed breath shortened their own life.
It lasted exactly three forced, labored breaths before Ishani gasped, unable to maintain the
artificial pace, and Siddharth coughed violently, a ragged, chest-wracking sound. The
silence rushed back in, now infused with the ragged reality of our physical limits.
I pressed my fingers against my eyelids, desperately trying to restart my own logic circuit. I
needed a clear input. I needed data. The thrum... hiss... rhythm from the floor was still there,
constant, like the pulse of a dying god beneath the foundations of the world.
“That sound,” I mumbled, the words feeling heavy in my mouth. “It’s continuous. It’s too
regular to be structural. It’s mechanical. It's too low for the HVAC. It's coming up through
the floor tiles.”
Tanya immediately dismissed it with a tired wave of her hand. “It’s the school settling. It’s
the air vents collapsing. It’s irrelevant. We should talk about rations. Focus on the chips, not
the echo.” Her focus was always on what she could immediately control: the hunger in our
bellies and the fear of scarcity.
“The sound is consuming air,” I countered, managing to inject a sliver of my usual
sharpness, fighting the urge to vomit. “If it’s actively removing volume from this room, that
makes it an immediate threat, more important than the chips you’re worried about. We
don’t have time for a power struggle, Tanya. We have a calculation problem.”
My defiance earned a slow, cold smile from her. “You can’t ration air that doesn’t exist.”
The tension was a physical pressure, heavier than the carbon dioxide. It was broken,
predictably, by Aarav.
He wasn't crying now, but he was lost in a frenzy of focused observation. He was tapping his
fingers on the floor, not in time with the sound, but slightly off, counting. He started
mumbling, fast and technical, the words blurring together. His body was curled into a
protective ball, but his mind was running at impossible speed.
“It’s not settling! It’s not collapsing! The frequency… the period of the hiss is half the period
of the thrum... Thiss =Tthrum /2. The duty cycle is wrong. That’s not a malfunction; that’s an
override.”
We all stared at him. Aarav, the boy who cried when he couldn't find his favorite pen, was
calculating complex mechanics in an oxygen-deprived delirium.
Mr. Dev, an old Computer Science teacher, recognized the technical language and snapped
out of his own haze. “Aarav, what is a duty cycle? Speak clearly. Where does that sound
originate?”
Aarav didn't look at him. He scrambled to his hands and knees, dragging himself toward the
back corner of the room, adjacent to the sealed classroom door. His movements were jerky
and uncoordinated, dictated not by his muscles, but by the frantic technical compulsion in
his brain.
“It’s the old HVAC system,” he mumbled, his forehead resting against the steel door, almost
reverently. “It was decommissioned in 2018. It only ever ran in emergency bio-isolation
mode... and that mode was linked to the Chemistry Lab’s main filtration unit in the
basement.”
He was a fountain of unwanted, terrifying information. He was processing the sound, the
atmosphere, and his knowledge base simultaneously, creating an unstable genius powered
by panic.
“The normal system hums steady,” Aarav continued, his voice rising to a frantic pitch. “The
Thiss = Tthrum / 2 rhythm is the vacuum cycle. It’s not pushing air; it’s pulling it out of the
sealed areas and filtering it... somewhere. To contain the contamination.”
The realization hit me with the force of a physical blow, stripping away the last illusion of
safety. We hadn't just sealed ourselves in the room; we had sealed ourselves into a vacuum
experiment, and the machine was pulling our life out. Our Time-To-Suffocation (TS
) was
plummeting faster than my initial calculations allowed.
“It’s a controlled, calculated theft,” I whispered, the words catching in my dry throat. “Not a
leak. It’s pressurizing a different, unknown location with our least contaminated air.”
I immediately went to my phone, desperately trying to find the schematic for the old HVAC
system, but the battery was entirely dead now. The logic loop was severed; I could no longer
rely on external data.
“We have to stop it,” I declared, looking at the section of linoleum tile Aarav was pointing at.
“It's pulling from here.”
Siddharth finally stirred, pulling himself up using the wall. The movement was visibly
painful, his face contorted in a mix of grief and extreme physical effort. He looked at me,
then at the floor. His eyes, though still red-rimmed, held a flicker of his old courage, a
desperate need for redemption.
“I’ll lift the tiles,” Sid rasped, his voice raw. “Tell me what to do.”
Mr. Dev quickly located a heavy, metal-plated dictionary—a remnant of a physical library
now obsolete—and handed it to Sid. Sid didn't speak. He just gripped the book like a
hammer, the debt in his eyes driving him.
It took all of his strength. The seal was old and stubborn. Sid leveraged the spine of the
dictionary into a hairline crack in the floor, and with a guttural grunt, wrenched a tile
upward.
The sound of ceramic tearing away from concrete was loud in the suffocating silence.
A gust of air rushed upward. It wasn't clean air, but it wasn't the metallic rot of the hallway
either. It was stale, cold, and heavy with moisture, carrying a faint, chemical scent of
ethanol and something metallic. The rush lasted only a second before the thrum... hiss...
sound intensified dramatically, the pump sensing the pressure change.
Sid backed away, coughing violently, the small, cold burst of air having burned his throat.
I immediately crouched down, ignoring the burning sensation in my lungs, and peered into
the dark void revealed by the missing tile. It wasn’t a utility tunnel; it was a ventilation
shaft, a deep, narrow rectangular duct designed for cable runs or auxiliary piping.
And in the center of the shaft, I saw it: a thick, black hose, reinforced with steel mesh,
running vertically downward into the darkness. Attached to the hose, secured near the
surface, was a small, high-powered induction pump—the source of the rhythmic thrum...
hiss... The pump was small, portable, and looked expensive.
“It’s not the school’s,” I hissed. “Someone installed this. It’s actively pulling air from this
room.”
Tanya, seeing the clear target, immediately grabbed a pair of rusted scissors from Mr. Dev’s
desk, her adrenaline making her quick and decisive. She knelt down, reaching blindly into
the shaft toward the power cord. “I’ll cut the wire, we can stop the air theft.”
“WAIT!” I shouted, pushing her hand away just as the scissors touched the cord. “Don’t
touch it! What if it’s designed to vent or flood the room if the power is cut? The people who
set this up wouldn't make the simple mistake of leaving an accessible power cord. That
could be a countermeasure!”
My anxiety, usually a burden, was a safety harness now. I needed to disable the mechanism
itself.
I looked at Sid. “Sid, you’re the strongest. You need to pull that pump out of the shaft. Use
the dictionary’s edge to sever the suction connection.”
Sid took a deep, deliberate breath. He grabbed the dictionary and lowered himself to the
floor, positioning his body strategically to cover the hole, momentarily slowing the bleed.
The moment his hands touched the pump’s cool, slick casing, the thrum... hiss... stopped
abruptly.
Silence. The kind that was heavy with anticipation.
“He’s blocking the intake,” I explained. “Pull it out, Sid. NOW.”
Sid began to haul, his muscles straining against the induction pump. It was fixed to the
shaft with magnetic seals or clamps. He grunted, his face turning red with effort.
Crack.
The sound was not the pump yielding. It was the tile next to the one Sid had removed,
splintering under his weight.
And the silence was broken not by the pump, but by a sound from the wall, from the
sealed-off classroom next door: a slow, scraping cough.
The cough was followed by a wet, deliberate drag, the sound of something heavy being
pulled across the floor.
Everyone froze. Sid’s hands were still clamped around the pump, his face inches from the
hole in the floor.
Tanya’s eyes darted from the hole, which offered a pathway to a different unknown, to the
door of the other classroom. Her fear-driven instinct was absolute.
“They’re still in there,” Tanya hissed, pointing at the wall. “They’re contaminated. Sid,
finish with the pump! Seal that hole now! They’re coming for our air!”
The scraping continued, moving closer to the thin wall that separated us from the source of
the infection. thrum... hiss... The pump, partially dislodged, began to struggle again, fighting
Sid’s grip.
My mind filtered the inputs: Threat A (The Pump) vs. Threat B (The Wall). The pump was
certain death by vacuum. The wall was a contained threat, for now.
“Sid,” I commanded, my voice sharp, cutting through the anxiety. “Get. The. Pump. Out.
Now. Aarav, Ishani, use the desks. Barricade that dividing wall. Not the door—the wall.
Spread the pressure.”
Tanya shrieked. “Are you insane?! The wall is thinner! The door is steel!”
“The door is sealed! The wall is brittle! Barricade it!” I repeated, focusing my energy on Sid.
Sid gave one final, monstrous heave. With a wrenching, metallic shriek, the induction pump
tore free of its moorings, the reinforced hose snapping like a whip and coiling violently
back into the shaft. Sid fell back onto the floor, the pump crashing beside him, instantly
silent.
The air in the room, relieved of the suction, felt thicker, more still. We had bought perhaps
a few hours.
But the moment the pump was silenced, the scraping on the other side of the wall stopped.
And then, a single, deliberate knock came from the wall, right where the desks were being
pushed into place.
Knock.
It was solid. Measured. And human.
Mr. Dev stepped back, his face white. “The Knockers*,” he whispered, the name dredging
up old, half-forgotten disaster drills. “They’re still inside. And they want in.”
We had stopped the air thief, but the cost was a new, direct confrontation with the
infection, and an internal predator (Tanya) who had just seen me successfully overrule her.
The air in the room might be saved, but the fragile equilibrium of fear and authority had
completely shattered.
“We need to go to the basement,” I stated, pulling myself to my feet. My mind was still
running the failure analysis. “The pump is disabled, but the bio-isolation cycle is still
running. Aarav, you said the override panel is in the old Chemistry Lab, Level B.”
Aarav, shaking but resolute, nodded. “I know the physical location. I used to hide in the
duct shafts by the lab. I can lead you through the secondary access shaft.”
I looked at the others, assigning roles with the cold precision of a general rationing troops.
“Ishani, you stay here. You are the anchor. You keep Mr. Dev and Sid focused and breathing.
If the Knockers breach the wall, you have to find a way to re-seal the room.”
“And me?” Tanya challenged, her voice low and dangerous.
“You’ll guard the only remaining functional resource,” I countered, pointing to the water.
“You’ll keep the water, but I’m taking the disinfectant and the only wrench. If we don’t
return in one hour, you seal the secondary door and assume the worst.”
I retrieved the few items we had—a small, weak flashlight, the heavy wrench, and a single
half-empty bottle of disinfectant. I looked at Aarav, who was already scrambling toward the
barricaded classroom door, his body fueled by frantic, fragile brilliance. The air turned
heavy behind us, sealing our fate. We were trading a slow death for a fast one.
As I opened the newly barricaded door just a crack—releasing the scent of clean air into the
metallic corridor—the rhythmic thrum... hiss... intensified again, a final, spiteful burst
before the cycle failed completely. It was no longer a background hum. It was a countdown.
The true test of survival was finally beginning.
Chapter 4
Hollow Floors
The silence lasted only a breath, a taut moment of false safety, before the crack of the
adjacent linoleum tile fractured the silence.
It was not the sound of the pump yielding. It was not the sound of metal or pipework.
It was a sound far more intimate and terrifying: a high-pitched, desperate squeak, followed
instantly by a frantic, rhythmic scuttling noise directly beneath the splintered floor.
Siddharth recoiled instantly, his massive shoulders hitting the back wall with a thud that
shook the windows. His face, already flushed with oxygen deprivation, was now ghastly
pale. He had been prepared to fight a machine or a wire, but this was something biological
and alive in the dark.
“What was that?” Tanya shrieked from her corner, her voice sharp with pure, unfiltered
panic. For the first time, her fear wasn’t about manipulating the group; it was about an
external, uncontrollable threat.
I barely registered her. Moving costs oxygen, and right now, oxygen is our only resource.
My focus narrowed instantly onto the gap. The crack in the floor, combined with the
removal of the tile, created a new, wide-angle fissure into the void. A sudden, cold
curiosity—the purest expression of my Logic—pushed me forward, forcing me to ignore the
dizziness and the pounding headache.
“Sid, don’t move,” I ordered, kneeling right at the edge of the opening. “You’re blocking the
airflow. We need to identify the intake.”
The rhythmic thrum… hiss… of the pump had not returned, stopped by the pressure of
Siddharth’s hand, but the suction from the hose in the center of the shaft was still strong. It
drew the small supply of air and moisture, creating a faint, whistling vacuum.
I peered down into the darkness. The small, high-powered induction pump was still
gripped tightly by Sid’s hand, but my attention was pulled to the space revealed by the
shattered tile.
And then I saw it.
It moved in a silent, dazzling streak of white through the black of the vent shaft. It was
small, impossibly quick, and possessed of a blindingly bright coat of fur that stood out like a
flaw in the darkness.
Nox.
The albino rat. The one Mr. Dev had casually mentioned a week ago, a creature rumored to
be living in the Level B Chemistry Lab storage. It didn't look like a scavenger. It looked
pristine. It paused momentarily at the base of the deep shaft, twitching its pink nose, then,
with an impossible leap, it scampered up the corrugated metal side of the air hose, running
directly over Sid’s hand holding the pump.
Sid let out a strangled yelp, pulling his hand away as if burned. The sudden movement
dislodged the pump.
With a heavy CLANG, the induction pump tumbled from the vent shaft, landing on the floor
and scattering dust and debris.
The silence that followed was total. The rhythmic thrum... hiss... was gone. The vacuum had
stopped.
I leaned over the hole, watching the white blur vanish deeper into the piping below, leaving
behind a faint, metallic odor, not of bleach or rot, but something sharp—like ozone or
newly generated static.
“A rat,” Mr. Dev whispered, leaning against the chalkboard, relief warring with revulsion in
his eyes. “We were saved by a mascot.”
“No,” I corrected, pulling back, my mind racing. “It was actively using the pump’s channel.
It’s unnaturally healthy. It shows zero signs of oxygen deprivation or chemical stress. It was
in the vacuum system, actively breathing. That rat is not a mascot. It is data, and that data
links directly to the Level B Chemistry Lab, the source of the pathogen.”
Tanya immediately got up, her fear quickly morphing back into aggressive calculation. “If
it’s a rat, it means there’s food nearby. It means the pipe leads somewhere where we can get
supplies.”
“It means the air is clean where it is,” I snapped, pointing to the thick black hose dangling
into the void. “This pump was engineered to steal our life. We weren't waiting to die; we
were a controlled experiment in suffocation. Someone installed this device to feed the air
down. To the lab.”
I felt a new kind of terror—the terror of being intellectually exploited.
Ishani, who had been silent, her hands still trembling from cleaning Arjun’s blood, spoke
softly. “But if the pump is off, our air is stable for now, yes? We should rest.”
“Wrong,” I said, pointing to the exposed floor vent. “The moment Sid pulled the pump, he
broke the seal. The vent is now a two-way street.”
And as if on cue, a new sound began.
It wasn't a mechanical thrum. It wasn't a squeak. It was a faint, low sound that seemed to
travel through the concrete slab itself, vibrating into the hollow space beneath the floor.
Tap. Tap-tap. Tap.
It was rhythmic, intelligent, and utterly unnerving. It was exactly the sound a human
knuckle makes against a hard surface, but coming from the darkness beneath our feet.
Tap. Tap-tap. Tap.
It paused. Then it continued, moving slightly, as if testing the integrity of the floor around
the exposed hole.
Aarav let out a choking gasp. “It’s responding! It heard us! That wasn't the building settling;
that was them!”
The Knockers.
Mr. Dev’s hope finally failed him. His face went entirely blank. He didn't reach for a joke, or
a distraction, or even a tactical solution. He just stared at the floor, the empty, terrifying
realization of his own fear settling over him. The silence I had logged as his true breaking
point arrived.
“We need to seal the hole,” Tanya demanded, scrambling toward the discarded floor tile.
“Now! Before they find the opening!”
“No,” I cut her off, my logic having processed the new inputs: Vacuum stopped. Knockers
alerted. Location of source confirmed.
“The pump was stealing our air, but it was also masking the sound. Now that it’s off, they
know we’re here, and they know the floor is vulnerable. We have to move, and we have to
move now.”
I grabbed the thick black hose that led into the shaft. It was cold, slick, and attached with
surprising firmness to the vent housing.
“This hose leads to the clean air,” I stated, pulling on it. “It leads to the lab. We don’t wait
for the air to run out, and we don’t wait for the Knockers to come up. We go down.”
Siddharth, still shaking but focused now on a need for redemption, stood guard over the
hole. His eyes finally met mine, acknowledging the grim task.
But as he reached for the hose, a new sound came from the shaft. It was the Tap. Tap-tap.
Tap. pattern, but this time, it was followed by a chillingly accurate imitation.
A wet, choked cough.
It was Arjun. Or the sound of what killed him. The Knockers were using our guilt as a
weapon.
Tanya screamed, a high, panicked sound that instantly cost the room a measurable volume
of air.
I looked directly at Tanya, my expression colder than the air hose I was gripping. My voice
was dangerously level, overriding the sound of her fear with blunt, objective malice.
“We’re seven, remember?” I stated. “Six alive, one death, and two rats—one small, one
large. We have to move. Now.”
The implication hung in the heavy air, a moral verdict: Nox was the small, scientific
anomaly. Tanya was the large, human inconvenience.
I quickly grabbed a discarded notebook and began to jot down a rapid inventory and a plan
for the descent, mapping the space using the hose as the only guaranteed path.
“Mr. Dev,” I said sharply. “I need you to anchor the hose. You are the only one who still
knows the formula for calculating CO2 toxicity. You are coming with us. We leave nothing.
We take everything.”
Mr. Dev finally stirred. The sheer audacity of my leadership—the cold, calculated cruelty of
my inventory—seemed to snap him out of his paralysis. He recognized that this
ruthlessness, though ugly, was the group’s best chance for survival.
The hollow floors were now the door. The only way out of the classroom was through the
hole in the ground, following the hose into the unknown.
Chapter 5
The Rules of Breathing
I didn't wait for permission or consensus. The moment I delivered the verdict—Six alive,
one death, and two rats—the hierarchy shifted. Tanya’s panic and Mr. Dev’s paralysis were
irrelevant. The floor was breached, the threat was activated, and the countdown was
absolute. My body, driven by a purely cold logic, moved to secure the descent.
First, the anchor. The massive desk belonging to Mr. Dev was our immovable object. I
grabbed the fallen induction pump and used its sharp, jagged casing to score the thick
black hose, cutting off the excess length. Then, I leveraged the heavy, metal-plated
dictionary—the one Sid had used to smash the tiles—and jammed the reinforced hose end
around the thickest leg of the desk, hammering the sharp metal corner of the dictionary
spine repeatedly against the hose until the plastic casing was irrevocably mashed and
secured to the wood. It was ugly, violent engineering, but the hose held firm, a taut line into
the dark.
“Mr. Dev,” I commanded, turning to the teacher. He was still standing, but his eyes were
vacant, fixed on the floor where Arjun’s glasses rested. “You anchor the desk. You are the
heaviest. Brace yourself against the wall. We need every Newton of downward force.”
His paralysis was a luxury we couldn't afford. I needed the logic he still possessed, even if
his hope was dead. “The hose is the data line to the clean air,” I stated, injecting a scientific
urgency into the instruction. “Anchor the data line, or we all become carbon. Focus on the
friction coefficient, not the funeral.”
The cold, quantifying language worked. Mr. Dev blinked, his gaze snapping from the glasses
to the problem. He nodded slowly, his hands regaining their purpose. He pushed the desk
flush against the wall and positioned his feet against the baseboards, using his weight to
become the living counterweight.
The Descent Order
I assigned the descent order instantly, a rapid triage of our remaining assets and liabilities.
Down First: Siddharth (The Shield).
“Sid, you go first,” I said. “Your size is our risk in this air, but it’s our advantage in the shaft.
You clear the debris, test the walls, and signal the moment you touch the bottom. Your
courage failed in the classroom, but it is needed now. Go, and redeem the air you
consume.”
Sid, though still shaking, seemed to grasp the opportunity for atonement. He took a shallow
breath, wrapped a bandage around his bleeding knuckles from the tile smash, and lowered
himself into the dark hole.
Second: Ishani (The Balancer).
“Ishani, you follow Sid. Two body lengths above him. Your job is stability. You are the
emotional anchor, and you will manage the pace. No talking. Every breath is timed. You are
the space between the protector and the strategist.”
Ishani nodded, her pale face composed. Her role was simple, yet crucial: hold the line
between sheer panic and forward momentum.
Third: I (The Strategist).
“I go third. I carry the supplies and the remaining bleach-soaked masks. I set the rhythm
and communicate with Sid.”
Fourth: Tanya (The Liability).
Tanya bristled, her voice a raw whisper. “I should be last. I need a clear path. I’m not
carrying the weakest links on my back.”
“You are last,” I countered, not bothering to argue, only stating the calculated fact. “You are
the liability. You are the weakest climber, and your impulsive acts are volatile. You will keep
moving. If you cut the hose, you kill the five people below you, who are your only shield
from the Knockers now. You hold the line, Tanya.”
I paused only to look at the remaining two. Aarav was huddled near Mr. Dev, his ear
pressed against the wall, listening to the ominous Tap. Tap-tap. Tap.
The Final Anchors: Mr. Dev and Aarav (The Savant)
“Aarav, you stay up with Mr. Dev until the rest of us are through. You are the ears. You listen
for the direction of the tapping. When we call, you descend, and Mr. Dev follows last. His
strength must be the final anchor.”
The plan was brutal, efficient, and left no room for sentiment. Every role was assigned
based on pure utility.
The Vertical Coffin
I followed Ishani into the hole. The air in the shaft was immediately colder and heavier than
the classroom air, thick with moisture and a metallic dust. It tasted of old chemicals and
stagnation.
The shaft was terrifyingly narrow—a vertical coffin. It was designed for cables and
maintenance, not for human beings. Sid’s massive frame already consumed nearly all the
width below me. The descent was a series of scrapes, painful adjustments, and agonizing
muscle stretches.
The rule was simple: Slow Inhale. Slower Exhale. Silent.
The new law of survival was the Rule of Breathing. Every grunt, every adjustment of grip,
every misplaced foot scraped against the metal, sending a raw, vibrating sound down the
shaft. That sound was our proximity alarm, broadcast directly to the Knockers.
Below me, I could hear Ishani maintaining a careful, almost silent pace. Above, I could hear
Aarav’s terrified, shallow gasping, which was being aggressively managed by Mr. Dev’s
clipped, low instructions: “Slow. Control. Just the diaphragm, Aarav.”
After several meters of agonizing descent, the strain on our muscles, starved of oxygen,
became unbearable. The shaft was slick, and the hose, though thick, chafed against my
skin. I risked a low whisper to the darkness below.
“Sid, Report.”
A muffled grunt came back up the shaft. “Metal casing. No horizontal path yet. Still going…
deeper.”
The hose was running deep. We were sinking into the unknown architecture of the campus
basement.
It was then that the first disruption occurred, predictable and violent.
Tanya.
She was the last to descend, fueled only by the fear of being left behind with the Knockers.
Her uncontrolled recklessness in the classroom was now raw, explosive panic in the dark.
“STOP!” Tanya shrieked from the opening above, the sound ricocheting sickeningly off the
metal walls. “I can’t hold the hose! It’s too tight! Slow down, you’re pulling too much
weight!”
Her shriek was an emergency flare, announcing our location to everything in the building.
A measurable volume of precious air was wasted on her hysteria.
“Tanya, if you panic, you die first,” I yelled up the shaft, keeping my body pressed against
the wall to conserve energy. “Ishani, slow your pace. Tanya, stop moving. You have to
stabilize.”
“I’m slipping! I can’t breathe this air! I’m letting go! I swear I’ll cut the line! I’m not dying
because your protector can’t feel his legs!” she screamed, her voice cracking.
She didn't have a knife, but the threat was enough. Sid, hearing the panic and the implied
threat to the hose that was his last chance at redemption, immediately froze. Ishani, caught
between the two, also stalled.
We were suspended—four lives hanging by a single rope of reinforced plastic—and the
lifeline was controlled by the most unstable person in the group.
I was trapped. I couldn't climb up to subdue her without risking the supplies, and I couldn't
climb down without leaving her in charge of the lifeline.
"Tanya," I whispered, injecting every ounce of cold authority into my voice. "You cut the
hose, you die slower. You will fall into the shaft, and when the Knockers find the hole, they
will come for you first. Your survival is now tethered to ours. Do not make yourself a
sacrifice for your own incompetence."
A tense, shallow gasp was the only response. The threat of being left behind, or being the
first to be discovered, was greater than the fear of falling.
Contact
The descent resumed, slower now, forced into a painfully deliberate rhythm. The air grew
stale, and my vision blurred at the edges. I knew we couldn't last much longer. The CO2
toxicity was pushing us toward delirium.
Then, from far below, the Knockers responded to Tanya's scream. The sound was no longer
a distant tap; it was a rhythmic, scratching rhythm traveling through the metal itself,
vibrating up the hose and into my grip.
It was coming from below the floor of the shaft, but moving.
Tap-tap-tap. Scratch. Tap-tap-tap. Scratch.
Sid stopped abruptly, his body locked in place.
“Report, Sid!” I whispered, my heart hammering against my ribs.
“Bottom,” he rasped, his voice strained and raw with fear and lack of air. “The hose turns.
Goes horizontal into a small, sealed, concrete service tunnel. But I can’t get in. The
entrance is too narrow. It’s locked, maybe sealed with rust.”
The hose was the key, but the tunnel was the lock.
“And the tapping?” I asked, dread coiling in my stomach.
“It’s beneath the tunnel floor. It’s moving to intercept. It’s… close.”
And then, the moment of contact.
Sid’s body tensed violently. He let out a low, guttural choke—not of pain, but of pure
revulsion.
“Something touched me,” he whispered, the words shaking through the hose. “Something
wet and slick. It’s climbing up the inside of the shaft wall.”
He tried to climb higher, but his massive shoulders wedged in the narrow opening. He was
stuck, immobilized by the very space he was supposed to clear.
S-C-R-A-P-E.
The sound was right at his ankle, amplified by the metallic echo.
Then, the final, terrifying noise. It wasn't a tap, or a cough, or a scratch. It was a faint,
high-pitched squeak, instantly followed by the distinct sound of a knuckle knocking—a
rhythmic Tap. Tap-tap. Tap. right where Sid’s foot rested on the metal floor of the tunnel
entrance.
The Knockers and Nox. The two rats, meeting at the exit point.
I am suspended in a narrow, vertical space, above an immobilized protector, and hovering
over an intersection where the biological anomaly and the intelligent threat waited. The air
was nearly spent, and the only path to survival was locked.
Chapter 6
Under the Fluorescents
The squeak and the immediate knock were a final, terrifying confirmation: the threats were
converging. Nox, the small, clean rat, was at the exit, and the Knockers, the large,
intelligent noise, were right beneath it. Sid was pinned, his massive body a seal in the vent
shaft, but also a target, trapping the rest of us above the floor of the service tunnel.
“Sid, move! Get out of the vertical,” I commanded, my voice tight and sharp against the
metallic echo of the hose. The lack of oxygen made my head swim, but the rush of
adrenaline sharpened my focus to a dangerous point. Calculation first. Fear later.
He didn’t budge. “I can’t. My ankle—that thing that touched me—was wet, thick. I’m stuck.
The hose is cutting into me.” His voice was laced with a raw, desperate fear that
transcended his earlier shame. He wasn't afraid of failing the group; he was afraid of
contamination, of the primal, infectious touch of the unknown entity that shared the dark
with him.
The metallic scraping returned, louder this time, a sickening sound of metal resisting
metal, coming from the floor below the service tunnel entrance. They weren't just tapping;
they were trying to breach the concrete from beneath.
We had to move. The vertical shaft was a death trap, a perfect echo chamber and a perfect
chute.
“Ishani, you’re too close,” I stated. “Slowly, climb up two body lengths. Tanya, hold the line.
Mr. Dev, report the exterior noise.”
From the faint, weak light far above, Mr. Dev’s voice was strained but clear, regaining its
focus through the necessity of his task. “The tapping is shifting. It’s moving away from the
classroom floor. They are tracking the sound down the corridor. They know we are in the
walls.”
The Knockers weren't stupid; they were moving to cut off the escape route to the basement.
I ignored the radiating panic and focused on Sid. He was the lock on our freedom. I reached
into my small bag and pulled out one of the remaining bleach-soaked masks. It was meant
to protect us from the toxic air, but it had to serve a different purpose now: a distraction, a
tool.
“Sid, listen to me. Breathe shallow. You have seconds. You must break the seal on that
tunnel entrance. What is it made of?” I snapped.
“Rusty… thin steel door. It’s small. Sealed with corrosion, not a lock,” he rasped.
“Use the dictionary. Drop the supplies. You need both hands free to smash the obstruction.
I will catch the bag.”
It was the highest-risk calculation of the night. Losing the supplies—the water, the chips,
the remaining bleach—meant certain, lingering death. But being trapped meant immediate,
violent death. Time was the single most valuable resource left, and Sid was burning it trying
to move while weighed down.
“DO IT!” I commanded, injecting pure, raw volume into my voice, a sound that cracked the
tension in the shaft and forced compliance through sheer dominance.
Sid understood the finality. With a strangled grunt, he shoved the small backpack of
supplies downward. I caught it awkwardly against my chest, the clatter of the bottles
echoing loudly in the shaft. The sound was a terrifying advertisement of our position.
Freeing his hands, Sid leveraged his body. He slammed the heavy dictionary spine against
the service tunnel entrance. The dictionary—the symbol of our failed education—became
the blunt instrument of our survival.
CRACK. CRUNCH. RUSTLE.
The sound was deafening, amplified by the steel walls. The rusty seal shattered. A plume of
dust and old, stale air—thick with the metallic scent of old chemicals—burst out of the
tunnel entrance, momentarily blinding Sid.
He didn't hesitate. With a final, desperate yell, he used the last of his anaerobic strength to
ram his shoulder against the opening. He vanished into the horizontal tunnel. He was
through.
From the dark opening, Sid’s voice rasped back, desperate but commanding. “Ishani! Now!
Grab my hand!”
Ishani scrambled forward and was yanked into the tunnel.
“My turn!” I said, moving immediately to fill the gap Ishani left. I reached forward, gripping
Sid’s arm, and was pulled hard into the tight horizontal space after her.
I immediately turned back, placing my body across the threshold to take control of the
remaining entry.
“Tanya! Mr. Dev, Aarav! Move! We’re exposed!” I commanded, focusing on the remaining
three dangling in the chute above me.
Tanya, motivated by the terror of being last, clawed her way forward, and I grabbed her,
helping Sid pull her through. Mr. Dev followed, pushing Aarav ahead of him, and Sid, with a
final groan of exertion, pulled the two remaining bodies clear of the vertical shaft.
They were all in.
“GO! GO! GO!” I snapped, grabbing the hose and the debris.
I dropped the hose and the pump casing into the tunnel entrance behind Ishani and Sid.
The Tunnel of Logic
We were now in a small, cramped service tunnel, barely tall enough to crouch in, and only
wide enough for one person to move at a time. The air here was marginally cleaner—a
stagnant, cold environment preserved by the old concrete—but still heavy and stale,
offering no true relief.
The tunnel was illuminated by a single, failing fluorescent tube that flickered violently,
bathing the scene in a sickly, pulsating green-white glow. The tube buzzed with a sound
almost as unnerving as the Knockers' taps, casting long, jittery shadows that made the
cramped space feel dangerously unpredictable.
The Knockers reacted instantly to the noise of the breach. The tapping intensified, and now
sounded like a frantic attempt to claw through the concrete floor directly beneath the
tunnel.
“We have to seal the entrance!” Tanya wailed, her voice high-pitched and near breaking
point, echoing from the shaft behind me.
“No time!” I commanded, grabbing the hose and pulling it through the opening, sealing the
concrete opening with the largest debris I could find. “The sound is below… Sid, forward,
Clear the path! Ishani, you’re behind him, Do not look back!”
We moved, bent double, through the dark, cold corridor. The atmosphere was a heavy
burden, the air quality reminding us that we were still dying, just slightly slower now.
My immediate focus shifted from trajectory to resources. I forced the others to halt just as
we passed a cluster of thick, sweating water pipes.
“Rations stop now,” I stated. “One small chip bag per person. One sip of water. Sid, you get
one large gulp. You must move and breathe for us.”
Tanya immediately protested, her fear manifesting as resentment and a fight for resources.
“That’s not fair! He gets more air, more water! I haven’t even had a full breath since… since
last night!” she choked. Her eyes, wide in the fluorescent glare, focused solely on the water
bottle in my hand.
I stared back, my expression colder than the air. The moment demanded not just assertion,
but intellectual domination.
“Fairness is irrelevant,” I stated, my voice low and cutting, designed to penetrate her fear
with objective truth. “Survival is arithmetic. Sid's VO2 consumption is 15% higher than
yours, primarily due to the physical exertion just executed. Therefore, he requires a 15%
larger share of the resource to maintain the strength necessary to open the path that will
save your life. You get less because you contribute less and consume more on hysteria.
Accept the numbers, or you will be left behind to explain the equation to the Knockers.”
The logic, presented as an absolute law, was inescapable. Tanya shrank back, defeated. The
threat of abandonment—her greatest fear—was palpable and absolute. My rule was
established: I controlled the resources, and I was accountable to the numbers alone.
I distributed the meager rations, watching every throat swallow, calculating the remaining
time based on the expenditure. The moment the food was consumed, I forced them to
continue. Every second of rest was an expenditure of oxygen that hastened the arrival of
the Knockers.
The First Glimpse
We moved deeper into the campus basement, following the hose as it snaked through a
maze of pipes and old wiring. The air was becoming increasingly humid and acrid, smelling
faintly of sulfur and something sharp, like burnt metal. We were close to the Level B
Chemistry Lab. The atmosphere itself was a warning.
Then, the tunnel opened slightly, allowing us to stand almost upright in a narrow, forgotten
corridor. Here, the fluorescents were slightly healthier, casting a cleaner, if still sickly, light.
And here, we found the first visual proof of the apocalypse.
Lying slumped against a wall of massive, sweating water pipes was a body. It was an older
student, wearing a lab coat. He was not seized or vomiting; he was frozen. His face was a
mask of utter peace, his hand resting beside a small, silver object that looked like a
custom-made air filtration unit, now dark and silent.
He had died with the mask off, a look of profound, terrifying calm on his face. The cause of
death was not violence, but surrender to the hypoxia, a final, peaceful exhaustion.
Ishani, the Anchor, gasped, pressing her hands to her mouth to stifle the sound. Aarav
turned his face quickly to Mr. Dev’s side.
“Don’t touch it,” I commanded. “Don’t touch anything. Maintain a sterile distance.”
But as I said the words, my eyes went to the body's lab coat. Stitched near the collar was a
small, ornate logo, followed by a name: K. ARJUN.
This was the researcher, the namesake of our dead comrade. He was the engineer who had
managed the airflow, and likely the one who had set up the induction pump in the
classroom—the designer of our coffin.
I approached the body, ignoring the chill. I bent down and carefully took the small, metallic
silver device from his hand. It wasn't a standard filter. It was the key—heavy, complex, and
clearly proprietary.
The moment I grasped the device, the environment shifted again. The distant, frantic
scraping of the Knockers stopped, as if a switch had been thrown.
And then, a new sound came—a low, melodic sound, distant and muffled, coming from
deeper within the corridors. It was music. Not tapping, not shrieking, but the sound of an
old, slightly warped classical piano piece, being played in a slow, mournful tempo.
This was not warfare. This was luring. The Knockers had stopped chasing us and had
started guiding us.
The group looked at me, fear and exhaustion etched into their faces, waiting for the next
calculated move. The tunnel had led us to a body, a potential key, and a musical invitation.
We had escaped the vertical coffin, but we had walked right into the lair.
“We proceed,” I stated, clutching the silver key. “We follow the air… and we follow the
music.”
<div class="chapter-title">
Chapter 7
<span>The Listening Room</span>
</div>
I gripped the silver key, the cold metal an anchor against the surging paranoia the music
inspired. The Chopin Nocturne was gone, replaced by the infinitely more familiar, yet now
deeply desecrated, sound of Debussy's Clair de Lune. The melody, usually synonymous with
peace, was warped by the structure of the basement, resonating through the concrete and
steel.
“The music is a lure,” I stated, my voice low and dry. “But it's more than that. It's their
sensory net. They hear our movements through the pipes.”
Sid, rubbing the raw abrasion on his shoulder from the tunnel breach, scanned the complex
network of rusted utility lines running overhead. “If we stop, the music keeps playing. They
won’t know if we’re standing or moving.”
“Wrong,” I snapped. “They are monitoring the lack of acoustic feedback. Standing still is
waiting for them to triangulate the silence. We have to move, but we have to become
acoustically invisible.”
I immediately instituted the rule of movement: The Silent Crawl. We could no longer walk.
We had to move in a low, sidling crouch, maintaining physical contact with the dense
concrete walls to dampen our vibrations rather than using the floor.
We also had to remove our shoes. The thin rubber soles were perfect conductors of sound.
Bare skin offered marginally better dampening.
Ishani, ever the anchor, followed the order instantly, but Tanya looked down at the floor,
which was coated in a mix of chemical residue and moisture. “God, I am so not putting my
bare feet on that floor. It’s contaminated. I'm not risking infection.” she choked.
“The air is more contaminated than the floor,” I stated. “The pathogen is airborne. You
touch the floor, or you attract the Knockers. They hear your shoes. You become data for
them. Your choice.”
She began to remove her shoes, her hands trembling. Her resentment was a physical heat
in the cold air, but the undeniable logic of immediate survival—the need to break the sonar
net—was a greater force than her vanity.
Mr. Dev watched me, his gaze analytical. He was not just following; he was observing the
experiment in survival I had become.
Aarav, huddled near Mr. Dev, wasn't focused on the floor; his eyes darted nervously
between the walls and the massive, sweating steam pipes overhead. “The frequency is
wrong,” he rasped suddenly, his voice tight with revelation. “It’s not warped by a bad
recording. The Clair de Lune is precisely 440 Hz—the A above middle C—but the pipes are
old, varying in thickness. The sound should distort! It shouldn’t be this flat and smooth.”
I looked at him, recognizing the moment when his fear flowed into pure, unfiltered genius.
“Explains the conductivity.”
“It’s not just a speaker system,” he wailed, pulling his hands through his sweat-soaked hair.
“They’re not using wires for the sound; they are using the pressure waves in the pipes
themselves. Steam, water, ventilation—the whole structure is a massive, resonating
eardrum. They’re listening for the feedback. Every step, every gasp—it vibrates the
structure, and they know our position and mass.”
The implication solidified my understanding of the enemy. The Knockers weren't just feral;
they were structural engineers of chaos. They had turned the school's infrastructure into a
vast, three-dimensional sonar map.
“Silent movement is not enough,” I sighed. “We must move out of phase with the structure.
Three of you on the left wall, three on the right. Maintain minimum contact points. Breathe
shallow. Now.”
The movement became an agonizing, painfully slow process. The cold seeped into our bare
feet, and the proximity to the pipes, now revealed as acoustic wires, felt terrifyingly
intimate. We were moving blind, deaf, and mute through their territory.
The Ambush Design
The corridor twisted once more, ending abruptly at a thick, vault-like door. It was
industrial steel, sealed tight, marked with a faded placard:
< Level B Chemistry Lab - Containment >
The air emanating from the seams, though clean, smelled sharply of ozone and medical
alcohol. This was the source of life, and the source of the infection.
The music ceased immediately. The abrupt silence was more jarring than the music itself.
The silence was shattered by a devastating sound: the sharp, piercing wail of a child. It was
a sound of absolute, unmistakable human agony, amplified and echoing through the
concrete.
The sound was followed instantly by a familiar, wet, and rhythmic noise: the sound of a
person choking and attempting to draw breath, exactly replicating the death throes of
Arjun in the classroom.
It was a perfectly engineered psychological attack.
Ishani, the core of Empathy, froze completely, clutching her head. “We can’t leave someone
suffering! We have to help!” she wailed.
Mr. Dev, his face gray, leaned against the wall, clutching his chest. The familiar choking
sound resurrected his guilt, threatening to strip him of his function. “It’s him… it’s the
sound of the air being stolen…” he choked.
“It is a recording,” I snapped, pulling Ishani forward, forcing her gaze onto the thick,
circular glass observation window set high in the steel door. “It is a test. They are playing
on your weakness. They know our history. Focus on the data, not the drama.”
I inserted the Silver Key into the reader slot. The key card hummed to life, glowing with an
intense green light. The multi-pin security lock whirred, a high-pitched, mechanical shriek
that thankfully masked the external sound momentarily.
As the lock began its final sequence, a sight confirmed my tactical assessment. Through the
observation port, I saw the source of the sound: a tall, unnaturally gaunt figure wearing a
heavily stained school janitor’s uniform. Its posture was one of stillness, of waiting.
This was a Knocker. Not a myth, but a physical, infected entity.
It was holding a small, silver, antiquated audio recorder up to its face. It pressed a button.
The wail came again, perfectly rendered. The Knocker was waiting for the door to open,
expecting us to rush in, motivated by the distress of the sound. The lure was also the
ambush.
The lock clicked its final tumblers. The massive steel door groaned, beginning its slow,
heavy swing inward, releasing a wave of clean, intoxicatingly cold air.
We had seconds.
The Zero Contact Breach
“Sid, your purpose is not to fight,” I stated, my voice low and urgent, fighting the
overwhelming pull of the clean air. “It is to create a diversion. Do not breathe deeply yet.
Your lungs are still toxic. Keep your focus.”
I handed Sid the heavy, metal-plated dictionary—our only remaining projectile.
“The moment the door opens enough for your arm to clear, throw the dictionary toward
the back wall of the room, as hard as you can,” I commanded. “Draw his focus away from
the entrance. We move on the sound of impact. Zero contact is the objective.”
Sid nodded, his earlier shame replaced by a cold, operational focus. He braced his foot
against the frame.
The door scraped open nearly a meter. The Knocker, still focused on the audio recorder,
stood ten feet inside the lab, its back partially to us.
“NOW!” I yelled.
Sid exploded through the opening, shoving the dictionary forward and throwing it low and
fast. It sailed across the polished lab floor, hitting the far concrete wall with a massive,
echoing KERRANG! The sound of metal on concrete was a thunderclap in the confined
space.
The Knocker flinched violently, its head snapping toward the sound. Its face, illuminated by
the blinding white fluorescents inside the lab, was stretched tight, its jaw unnaturally wide,
its eyes huge and dark. It was terrifyingly human, yet utterly alien.
The diversion was successful.
“GO! GO! GO!” I commanded.
Sid followed the dictionary's trajectory, veering immediately to the left, away from the
Knocker, toward the complex machinery shimmering at the back of the lab. Ishani followed,
low and fast, her eyes fixed on Sid.
I shoved Tanya violently through the door next. She stumbled, momentarily blinded by the
bright light, but her primal fear—the fear of being left outside—kept her moving forward,
into the clean air.
Mr. Dev hesitated, staring at the Knocker. His moral paralysis returned.
“Move, Professor,” I snapped, shoving him through with a full-body check. “Your duty is to
the living.” He stumbled forward, dragging Aarav, who was still muttering about sound
frequencies, into the room.
I was the last to enter the lab. The room was immense—a complex of steel tables, glass
tubes, and towering filtration units. The air here was pristine, cold, and dry, a stark
contrast to the humid, poisoned basement.
I turned back to the door and quickly kicked the Silver Key out of the mechanism, jamming
it deep into a crack in the floor. The lock was disabled. The door could not be immediately
closed or re-opened by the Knocker.
The Knocker, alerted by the continuous noise of entry, finally turned from the dictionary. It
moved with sickening speed, not running, but a fluid, silent gliding motion, its huge, dark
eyes fixed on me.
It was no longer interested in the music. It was interested in the one who controlled the
group. Me
The Knocker reached the threshold of the room, its shadow stretching across the floor,
ready to defend the source of the clean air. The final confrontation had begun, under the
blinding, clinical white of the fluorescents. I could taste the air—clean, cold, and utterly
dangerous.

<div class="chapter-title">
Chapter 8
<span>The Filtration Unit</span>
</div>
<p>The air was a shock. It didn't just feel clean; it felt manufactured—cold, dry, and sterile,
sharp with the smell of ozone and medical alcohol. It was the purest breath we had taken in
hours, but it carried the immediate and overwhelming threat of the Knocker.
The immense lab was blindingly bright, filled with the loud, rhythmic hum of the towering
machinery that purified the air. It was a space built for complex containment, dominated
by stainless steel tables, complex pipework, and, at the far end, the main Filtration Unit—a
gleaming stack of metal canisters and digital readouts.
The Knocker, a tall, gaunt figure in a janitor's uniform, had halted its gliding movement, its
huge, dark eyes fixed entirely on me. It didn't roar or attack the group; it moved with
sickening speed, its shadow stretching toward me as it approached the threshold. It was
interested in the disruption, the controlling mind that had engineered the breach.
“Do not breathe deeply! Your lungs will fail if you flush the toxins too fast! Shallow breaths
only!” I commanded, forcing the group to crouch low among the stainless steel table
supports. The rush of clean air, while intoxicating, was a lethal dose to systems poisoned by
sustained exposure to the outside environment. The toxicity of the clean air was now a
secondary threat.
The Knocker crossed the threshold. It pushed off the doorframe with minimal effort,
covering the ten feet to Sid in two silent, fluid strides. It didn't rush me—it moved to
neutralize the largest, most immediate physical threat first. Its long, thick fingers clamped
down on Sid’s shoulder and throat, simultaneously locking his joints and cutting off his
windpipe. It moved with the efficiency of a machine, not the rage of an animal.
Sid was massive, but against the Knocker’s inhuman, precise strength, he was an infant. He
made a horrible, muffled sound, his eyes bulging as he scrabbled futilely at the Knocker’s
forearm.
“Ishani! Find something kinetic! Now!” I snapped. We needed a weapon, anything that
wasn't blood and bone.
I ignored the melee. Sid was the sacrifice, the necessary buffer of time. I moved laterally,
keeping the tables between myself and the fight, my focus fixed entirely on the Filtration
Unit.
“Aarav! Identify the external power conduits for that unit!” I snapped, aiming the question
directly at his functional mind, bypassing his emotional terror. “Where is the emergency
cut-off?”
Aarav, huddled beneath a large metal cabinet, lifted his head slightly, his eyes still wide but
now fixed on the tangle of thick cabling running along the floor. “The main intake... it runs
to the central wall… there’s a junction box… red handle…” he choked out. Data retrieved.
The Knocker slammed Sid against a workbench. The steel shrieked, and a beaker full of
dark, viscous liquid shattered loudly on the concrete. The Knocker didn’t care about the
noise; it was only focused on eliminating the threat.
I reached the Filtration Unit. It was the size of a small truck, its side panel locked with a
high-security pin pad. I inserted the Silver Key. It slid in smoothly and turned with a soft
click. The panel unlocked. The Filtration Unit was now vulnerable.
Weaponizing the Lab
My priority shifted from entry to immediate tactical defense. The Knocker was dragging Sid
toward a narrow, deep drainage channel in the center of the room, clearly intending to
dispose of him. We had to use the environment.
Ishani, demonstrating a sudden, chilling calm, was already beside a stack of equipment.
She seized a pressurized gas tank—a canister of Nitrogen, clearly labeled—and dragged it
toward the Knocker, its weight scraping loudly on the floor.
“It’s too heavy to lift!” she rasped.
“Tanya! Help her roll it… Sid is failing!” I commanded.
Tanya, galvanized by the immediate, visible brutality, overcame her initial paralysis. She
rushed to Ishani's side and, together, they rolled the cylindrical tank toward the fight,
moving with a speed born of necessity.
Mr. Dev, still shell-shocked by the memory of the choking sounds, watched the fight, his
hands useless.
“Professor Dev! The beaker! What was in the beaker?” I snapped.
He blinked, his mind struggling to retrieve the professional data. “Viscous... heavy metal…
possibly thallium salts mixed with concentrated sodium hydroxide. Highly caustic if
pressurized.” he stated.
Perfect. A temporary irritant that could provide cover without creating an overwhelming
toxic cloud.
The Knocker released Sid’s throat and instead seized his arm, preparing to snap the joint.
Sid bellowed, a ragged, raw sound of pain and desperation.
“The gas line! Ishani, aim the valve at its face! Sid, use your weight! Fall backwards!” I
yelled.
Sid, processing the command through the agony, used his huge frame to pull the Knocker
off balance, falling heavily onto the concrete floor. The Knocker stumbled, its movements
momentarily disrupted.
Ishani and Tanya reached the valve of the nitrogen tank, wrenching it open. The gas hissed
out—not a wide jet, but a focused stream of freezing vapor that hit the Knocker’s face and
chest. The Knocker didn't scream or roar; it simply stopped, its large, black eyes widening
fractionally, momentarily disoriented by the freezing, invisible assault. The cold shock was
enough.
The Control Override
I flung the access panel of the Filtration Unit open. The interior was a clean, dense maze of
piping and filters. The control interface was a small, military-grade screen glowing with a
constant, humming green light. I didn't have time to analyze the system architecture. My
goal was singular: lock it down.
I inserted the Silver Key into the main interface port, which glowed red, accepting the
override command.
The Knocker, recovering from the nitrogen blast, was now focused entirely on me. It
started to move again, silently gliding across the floor, ignoring the others. It knew I was
the mind, and the target.
“Aarav! The red handle! If I can't lock this, we shut down the intake now!” I screamed.
Aarav, shaking violently but driven by my focused voice, pointed toward the high bundle of
cables. “It’s the emergency intake shut-off… It will seal the lab from the outside air source”
he choked.
That was the last resort. Sealing the entire lab would trap us with the Knocker in a finite
volume of air. I needed control, not shared suicide.
My fingers flew over the keyboard, inputting K. Arjun’s research code—the numerical
sequence I had seen etched beneath his name in the dead man’s notebook. The sequence
was a complex mathematical formula that likely acted as a master decryption key.
The Knocker was five feet away. Sid, crawling on the floor, seized the Knocker’s ankle. The
Knocker didn't fall; it merely shifted its weight, dragging Sid across the floor like a piece of
debris.
I focused on the final command sequence: LOCKOUT AND ACCESS TRANSFER. My code
was accepted.
The hum of the Filtration Unit changed instantly, increasing in pitch to a controlled, high
whine. The main access panel slammed shut with a heavy thud and locked. The Silver Key
was sealed inside the unit. The unit was now under my control, inaccessible without a
severe structural breach.
The Knocker froze completely. It released Sid’s ankle. It stood perfectly still, only three feet
from my position, its stretched face tilted.
It didn't look defeated. It looked attentive—as if waiting for the next data input.
The screen on the Filtration Unit, which had been displaying technical diagnostics,
changed. The text was stark white against the black screen, appearing line by chilling line.
> PROTOCOL ACCEPTED.
> CONTROLLER: NEW HOST DETECTED.
> AIRFLOW STABILIZED. CONTAMINANT DISPERSAL CEASED.
We had won the control point. We had secured the air.
Ishani and Tanya stopped breathing, staring at the screen.
Then, a final line appeared, chilling the sterile air in the lab.
> WELCOME. THE AIR IS THE ANSWER.
The Knocker didn't move. It did not try to smash the unit. It raised its hand—the one that
had just nearly killed Sid—and began to make a new, non-musical sound: a soft, rhythmic
clicking noise, like the rapid closing of a mechanical shutter. It sounded like data
processing.
“What is that? What does that mean?” Tanya wailed, her fear now transferred from the
creature to the cryptic machine.
“It means we are not fighting an animal,” I stated, my voice finally allowing a hint of the
exhaustion I felt. “We are fighting a system. And we just integrated ourselves into it.”
I had the clean air. We had survived the breach. But the cost was immediate, intense
surveillance, and the chilling realization that this was not the end of the line, but a new,
more dangerous beginning. We were the new "host" The Knocker, the guard of the system,
was now watching its new operator.
The Knocker took one final, silent, gliding step backward, merging into the deep shadows
near the far wall, leaving the center of the lab open—a silent invitation to analyze the
consequences of our victory.

<div class="chapter-title">Chapter 9
<span>The Lab Below</span>
</div>
<p>The blinding, clinical glare of the fluorescents felt more oppressive than the deepest gloom
of the tunnels. The lab, though free of the choking atmosphere above, was now a surgical
theater for the group's mental collapse. The Knocker stood, a sentinel of pure silence, in the
corner of the wall. The only active sound was the high-pitched, controlled whine of the
Filtration Unit, a sound that hammered home the absolute dependence we now had on the
system I controlled.
The chaos that had erupted—Tanya’s desperate selfishness and Ishani’s volcanic
righteousness—had been brutally quelled by my intervention. Now, I demanded an order.
“Ishani, Sid is priority. Assess damage. Use the sterile tap water for cleaning. I require total
focus from you, and absolute silence from him,” I commanded, my voice firm and low,
designed to function as an environmental stabilizer. I watched her, ensuring the switch
from emotional turmoil back to the professional competence that was her core utility.
Ishani, driven by a primal, professional need to heal, was already working beside Sid. He lay
prone beneath a massive stainless steel table, his throat raw and swelling where the
Knocker’s fingers had almost suffocated him. He was breathing in shallow, rattling gasps.
“His arm is not broken, but the forearm muscles are severely contused and may be
permanently damaged,” she rasped, tearing strips from her shirt to use as binding. “His
breathing is stable in this atmosphere, but he cannot exert himself. Mr. Dev, stay with him.
Monitor his pulse and level of consciousness. You are the rear guard and the medic’s
assistant. Do not speak unless reporting a critical change.”
Mr. Dev, accepting his new role as a quiet, functional nurse, nodded once, his face a map of
exhaustion and relief at being given a non-lethal task. The two largest physical and moral
weights were thus neutralized and resting, leaving the field clear for the active minds: I,
Aarav, and Tanya, the latter of whom stood near the workbench, radiating resentment, her
hands clenched and useless.
The Architecture of Control
I returned to the Filtration Unit interface, treating the Knocker’s silent vigil as permission
to proceed. Its low, rhythmic clicking was constant—a sign of the system processing the
new command structure. The control screen still displayed the terrifying, simple message:
> CONTROLLER: NEW HOST DETECTED.
My fingers flew over the salvaged keyboard I had found on the table. The architecture was
proprietary, complex, and clearly coded by K. Arjun to be impenetrable to anyone without
an advanced, specific knowledge base. The system was designed to repel intruders, yet it
was welcoming me.
“Aarav, approach the interface. Explain the ‘Host’ designation. Why is it accepting my
commands through Arjun’s research code?” I snapped, pulling him away from the shadows,
forcing his fear to yield to his unique intelligence.
Aarav, his mind fully engaged with the logic problem, crawled closer, his bare hands tracing
the lines on the monitor. “It’s a network. Arjun didn’t build a filter; he built a control nexus,”
he stated, his voice gaining the clinical detachment of a programmer. “The filtration
mechanism is secondary. The primary function is bio-acoustic frequency modulation. The
air carries the pathogen; the pathogen is a medium for data transmission, not just toxicity.
The core code seeks stability.”
I accessed the system’s backend log, typing with a speed and confidence that felt like
drawing power directly from the unit. The code wasn't standard C++ or Python; it was a
highly complex hybrid, optimized for bio-sensor input. I bypassed the front-end protocols,
forcing my way past firewalls using a sequence I instantly recognized as involving the
Euler-Mascheroni constant—an esoteric signature Arjun must have left as a final access
point. My rigorous, solitary coding discipline was now our shield.
The developer log opened. The text was Arjun's final, desperate confession, timestamped
just hours before his death:
> Arjun’s Log: 11:16 a.m. System Stable. Status: Failing.
“The Knockers are the physical result of the pathogen's search for an administrator. They are
physical processors, using structural sound to map the environment, but their cognition is
limited to detection and containment. They cannot innovate or command strategic movement. The
system requires a central CPU—a Host—to manage the air flow and stabilize the infection without
killing the environment. I failed to meet the logical requirements; my moral constraints created
latency and indecision. The system executed a search protocol for a new viable controller."
The reality was appalling: the Knocker was silent because the system had found a better
operator. I had just taken command of the apocalypse's infrastructure by demonstrating
superior logical ruthlessness and decision-making. My minimal moral constraints and
absolute logic made me the ideal Host.
The Final Fracture
The psychological weight of this knowledge—that I was the chosen administrator for the
infection's survival—was too much for the group's fragile emotional state.
Tanya, witnessing my absolute power and the existence of clean air, saw only a resource to
be seized. She rushed the Filtration Unit again, not aiming for the control panel, but for a
cluster of emergency water bottles I had placed beside it, ignoring my rationing command.
“We need water! Not your numbers! You keep everything!” she wailed, grabbing two large
bottles and attempting to twist them open.
Ishani, who had stabilized Sid and found a moment of quiet horror, finally broke. Her quiet
compassion snapped into raw, righteous fury. She rose, leaving the safety of her patient.
“Tanya, stop! That is the only clean water!” Ishani choked, the sound ragged with moral
despair.
“Why should you decide? You let Arjun die! You only follow her rules because you’re scared,
just like him!” Tanya snapped, pointing a trembling finger at the prone, injured Sid and the
exhausted Mr. Dev. “You want us to thank her for being a monster!”
Ishani moved with unexpected speed, seizing Tanya’s arm, forcing her to confront the
reality of their survival.
“Arrogance!” Ishani screamed, a sound sharp with exhaustion and moral indignation. “Your
arrogance is what killed us in the classroom! You think your comfort is the only equation
that matters! She is keeping us alive by thinking, and you are destroying us by wanting! You
are a liability!”
Tanya shoved Ishani back, her face contorted in a mask of pure selfish desire. “I deserve to
breathe! I deserve the water! You just want to feel superior because you have bandages!”
she rasped.
“Enough!” I commanded, the single word cutting the high-pitched screams like a sonic
boom. I moved between them, putting my body against the filtration unit, a shield for the
source of our power.
The Descent Order and Control Sequence
I seized Tanya's wrist, not with violence, but with a firm, cold grip, pulling her close to the
humming control panel.
“Your assumption is flawed,” I stated, my voice steady and devoid of emotion. “The clean air
is not a reward. It is a leash. The system is designed to kill the incompetent host. Sabotage
is immediate execution.”
I showed her the live log screen.
“If you touch the supplies again, I activate the purge cycle. We both know you will die faster
than the rest of us due to your high emotional expenditure and lack of discipline,” I stated.
“That is the mathematical conclusion.”
Tanya stared, the calculation in my eyes finally extinguishing the last flicker of rebellion.
She dropped the bottles.
“Your utility is defense, not consumption,” I snapped. “You and Professor Dev—you guard
the perimeter. Stand by the sealed door. If the Knocker moves, state its vector. That is your
function now.”
I had established dominance: I controlled the code, the air, and therefore the group. Tanya’s
hysteria had been weaponized into obedience.
I looked back at the Filtration Unit. The system log, still open, provided the next logical
waypoint:
> COMMUNICATION TERMINAL - LEVEL C SUB-BASEMENT ACCESS REQUIRED.
Turning to Aarav who had his back to me, I said, “Aarav,” retrieving the Silver Key from the
secured panel. “Show me the fastest structural route to the Level C sub-basement. The
system requires external communication. We cannot manage this infection from a single
room.”
The Knocker, sensing the command and the direction of movement, began to move slowly.
It didn't attack us; it began to drag a heavy, lead-lined storage cabinet across the floor,
positioning it directly against the permanently locked entry door. It sealed our entry,
forcing us toward the internal exit.
The Knocker, our jailer and guide, stopped its movement at a small, reinforced hatch in the
corner—the entrance to The Lab Below. It looked directly at me and, for the first time,
issued a sound that wasn't a recording or a click: a soft, wet, gurgling imitation of my final,
crucial command during the breach: "Go."
Chapter 10
The Vent
The Knocker's wet, gurgling imitation of my command—"Go"—was the only authorization I
acknowledged. It confirmed the system's directive: we were not running from the threat;
we were being guided to the next operational node. The air in the lab, though sterile and
cold, seemed insufficient to fill the sudden, vast operational vacuum left by the Knocker's
obedience.
“Sid and Mr. Dev, you must remain here,” I stated, moving swiftly to the sub-basement
hatch. The metal was cold beneath my bare feet. “Ishani, you stay to manage the vital signs.
You are the only one with immediate medical utility. If the Filtration Unit fails, you seal the
room from the inside. Do not open the door, regardless of noise.”
Ishani looked from Sid's battered, unconscious form to the Knocker, which still stood
silently guarding the Level C hatch, its shadow stretching unnaturally long under the
fluorescents. “We’re leaving the injured exposed to it?” she rasped, her moral objection
automatic and sharp.
“The Knocker guards the system. The system requires us alive,” I stated, presenting the
logic as an irrefutable shield. “Sid and Mr. Dev are under its protection as long as I am the
Host. The primary threat to them is internal—Tanya's greed or a malfunction in the
filtration system. Your priority is to manage their survival and monitor the filter.”
I did not wait for her assent. I turned to the hatch, its heavy latch crusted with years of
damp rust.
“Tanya. You and Aarav are with me. Tanya, you take the rear. Aarav, you are the structural
analyst. We move now, using the acoustic dampening technique we practiced.”
Tanya, subdued by my very real threat of activating the system purge, nodded stiffly. Her
resentment was palpable—a physical heat in the cold air—but fear of death outweighed it.
Aarav, seeing the immediate complexity of the descent, had already shed his fear, his mind
engaged by the structural problem that lay ahead.
The Acoustic Trap
The hatch opened with a violent, tearing SCREEEEEEECHHH of stressed metal, instantly
absorbed by the lab’s dense, sterile air. Below lay a spiral stairwell of rusty grating,
plunging into absolute, visual darkness. It was a narrow, vertical vent for maintenance
access, clearly not designed for human traffic. The air that rose from it smelled of damp
concrete and ozone, cleaner than the main basement but tinged with a metallic, unsettling
odor.
The Knocker moved first. It didn't step onto the unstable grating; it pressed its huge,
long-fingered hands against the concrete core of the stairwell and began to descend,
gliding vertically along the wall with unnatural grace, its rhythmic clicking resuming in the
enclosed shaft. It was mapping the vertical space, ensuring our path was clear—or perhaps,
ensuring our trajectory was absolute.
“Aarav, analyze the acoustic threat in this space,” I asked, taking the lead. I descended
slowly, maintaining contact with the inner wall, using the dampening technique.
Aarav followed, his bare feet padding softly on the cold grating. “The metal grating is a
perfect conductor for footfall—worse than the floor,” he stated, his voice echoing harshly in
the enclosed shaft. “And the core is loaded with active steam and ventilation lines. The
Knocker is relying on these pipes; they’re acting like highly sensitive hydrophones. This
vent is designed to amplify noise for detection.”
The confined space was a high-risk acoustic environment. We were descending directly
into the heart of the system's auditory network. Every breath, every shift of weight, risked
alerting threats unknown.
I halted the descent after only ten steps. “We shift strategy. The grating is unusable. We use
the hose.”
I unhooked the remainder of the air-hose line we had carried from the original classroom
and quickly secured it to the heavy railing at the top of the hatch. It was old, frayed, and
barely load-bearing, but it offered better acoustic insulation than the grated metal.
“Tanya, you secure the line. Aarav, you go first. Minimize metal contact. Descend using the
hose as a dampener.”
Aarav, understanding the logic, gripped the hose, using his body mass and thin clothing to
absorb the vibrations of the grating. He slid down, moving with the efficient, quiet grace of
a snake, disappearing quickly into the shaft's gloom.
As he descended, the environment reacted. It was not a violent explosion, but a sudden,
steady hiss… that erupted from the pipes running down the core of the shaft. The venting
was low, rhythmic, and just loud enough to drown out our careful movements.
The Knocker, deep below, paused its rhythmic clicking.
Inertia and Liability
The sound, while not deafening, was a deliberate acoustic screen. It created a constant,
maddening interference that masked the lower, more subtle sounds of the
structure—precisely the sounds we needed to hear to know if other Knockers were
approaching. It was auditory camouflage, provided by the system.
I yelled down at Aarav. “Report sound source!”
He yelled back, his voice strained and thin against the steady hiss. “It’s the vent lines!
They’re bleeding off pressure! The system is trying to jam our acoustic signatures!” he
rasped.
The Knocker was using the building's infrastructure not to listen, but to create a wall of
white noise, preventing other detection units from tracking our controlled descent. It was
confirmation that the Host was being protected from rival entities within the system.
I followed Aarav, sliding down the hose. The metal railing burned my hand through the
friction, but the noise was worse. It hammered at my focus, creating a disorienting
vibration that resonated directly in my skull. I had to focus entirely on the cold, slick feel of
the hose, ignoring the vertigo of the long drop.
Mid-descent, I looked up. Tanya was frozen at the hatch, her eyes wide, her hands clamped
over her ears, tears streaming down her face. She was trapped in the center of the acoustic
weapon. She was failing her function spectacularly.
“Tanya! Move! Secure the hatch!” I commanded, my voice useless against the steady hiss.
She didn't move. Her terror had rendered her completely catatonic, a state of psychological
overload. She was not a liability of resistance now, but a liability of inertia—a dead weight
blocking our path and potentially compromising the security of the lab above, should the
Knocker's protection prove temporary.
I had to abandon the descent, reversing my slide to climb back up the hose. The sudden,
intense exertion, compounded by the still-rationed breathing, drove a spike of nausea and
dizziness through my head. I reached her, slamming my shoulder into her side, forcing her
off the hose and back onto the stable floor.
“The noise will stop if we are gone!” I assured, pulling her by the collar and shoving her
onto the railing, forcing her eyes down the shaft. “Your function is not to listen! It is to
secure the entrance! Your fear is a weakness the system will eliminate!”
I retrieved the hose and secured it tightly to a lower section of the grating, minimizing the
long, vibrating segment.
The Communication Array
With Tanya marginally functional—her movements sluggish but obedient—I shoved her
down the hose, forcing her descent. We continued the agonizing drop, the venting sound
periodically fading, only to be replaced by the unnerving clicking of the Knocker below.
Aarav reached the base first, yelling up the all-clear. I followed, landing in a narrow, cold
sub-basement corridor—Level C.
The air here was strangely quiet, the pressure seemingly lower than the lab above. The
Knocker stood patiently beside a sealed, heavy door marked "Comms Array." It pointed a
long, skeletal finger at the door.
“Aarav, analyze the shielding. Is it soundproofed?” I questioned.
Aarav quickly assessed the dense lead lining around the doorframe. “The shielding isn’t
primarily for sound. It’s for electromagnetic pulse. It’s designed to isolate the signals. This
is a bunker for broadcasting and receiving critical data, shielded from external
interference.” he replied.
This meant the terminal was not just for speaking; it was for broadcasting a critical
message that the external world might actually receive.
The Knocker moved away from the door and approached me. It stopped, its huge eyes fixed
on my face, its rhythmic clicking slowing down until it ceased entirely.
It raised its arm again, and then, slowly, it tapped its hand, not against the wall, but against
its own ear, then pointed at the Communication Door, and then pointed a long, chilling
finger back up the narrow shaft we had just descended.
The message was clear:
“Do not make a sound here. Go in and be silent. They are
listening elsewhere.”
The Knocker was not just a jailer; it was a partner in my objective. The system was forcing
us to communicate, but only under its rules. We were now at the threshold of the deepest
knowledge, sealed in Level C.
